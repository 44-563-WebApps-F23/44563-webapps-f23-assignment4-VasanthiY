                HILDA.<br>
                    Good morning, Mr. Solness!<br>
                    
                SOLNESS.<br>
                    [Nods.] Slept well?<br>
                    
                HILDA.<br>
                    Quite deliciously! Like a child in a cradle. Oh--I lay and stretched
                    myself like--like a princess!<br>

                SOLNESS.<br>
                    [Smiles a little.] You were thoroughly comfortable then?<br>

                HILDA.<br>
                    I should think so.<br>

                SOLNESS.<br>
                    And no doubt you dreamed, too.<br>

                HILDA.<br>
                    Yes, I did. But that was horrid.<br>

                SOLNESS.<br>
                    Was it?<br>

                HILDA.<br>
                    Yes, for I dreamed I was falling over a frightfully high, sheer
                    precipice. Do you never have that kind of dream?<br>

                SOLNESS.<br>
                    Oh yes--now and then--<br>

                HILDA.<br>
                    It's tremendously thrilling--when you fall and fall--<br>

                SOLNESS.<br>
                    It seems to make one's blood run cold.<br>

                HILDA.<br>
                    Do you draw your legs up under you while you are falling?

                SOLNESS.<br>
                    Yes, as high as ever I can.<br>

                HILDA.<br>
                    So do I.<br>
