                <h5>HILDA.</h5>
                    <p>Good morning, Mr. Solness!</p>
                    
                <h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
                    <p>[Nods.]</p>
                    <p> Slept well?</p>
                    
                <h5>HILDA.</h5>
                    <p>Quite deliciously! Like a child in a cradle. Oh--I lay and stretched
                    myself like--like a princess!</p>

                <h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
                    <p>[Smiles a little.] </p>
                    <p>You were thoroughly comfortable then?</p>

                <h5>HILDA.</h5>
                    <p>I should think so.</p>

                <h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
                    <p>And no doubt you dreamed, too.</p>

                <h5>HILDA.</h5>
                    <p>Yes, I did. But that was horrid.</p>

                <h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
                    <p>Was it?</p>

                <h5>HILDA.</h5>
                    <p>Yes, for I dreamed I was falling over a frightfully high, sheer
                    precipice. Do you never have that kind of dream?</p>

                <h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
                    <p>Oh yes--now and then--</p>

                <h5>HILDA.</h5>
                    <p>It's tremendously thrilling--when you fall and fall--</p>

                <h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
                    <p>It seems to make one's blood run cold.</p>

                <h5>HILDA.</h5>
                    <p>Do you draw your legs up under you while you are falling?</p>

                <h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
                    <p>Yes, as high as ever I can.</p>

                <h5>HILDA.</h5>
                    <p>So do I.</p>
